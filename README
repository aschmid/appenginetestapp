create an app on appengine
deploy it to the cloud

go into the fwsimple.py and fwthread.py files and update the domain variable to your apps domain.

the expected result for the 2 scripts are to create an entity on the first push and update it 
with a different name on all other requests

./fwsimple.py 

the responses of the app are as expected. only 1 entity is created and after 10 requests the name is '10'

./fwthread.py

because of multiple threads pushing the info simultaneously the and different machines are hit with the requests,
multiple entities are created. the result is not as expected!
